	description= _ "Henchmen are good for one thing: following orders. They are not very smart or creative, neither of which is required to swing a club at an enemy. Never far from their leader, they tend to work in groups (attacking one at a time). With enough experience they can learn to swing a bigger club or throw things, but not both."
