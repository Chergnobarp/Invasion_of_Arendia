In the end, after a private meeting with Jack they decided that it was best that he became Jack's apprentice, destined to take his place when he retired. It seemed that the Rangers were returning and their first would be a prodigy."

It was later said that Reth was the only one who dared to talk back to Jack, even when he beat him up, and the only one Jack allowed to do so without drawing blood. There was a strange respect formed between the two of them. Finally, there came the time for Jack to retire and Reth took his place as the only Ranger, silently and without fanfare."
